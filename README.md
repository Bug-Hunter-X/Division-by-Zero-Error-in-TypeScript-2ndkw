# TypeScript Division by Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: division by zero. The code includes a `try-catch` block to handle the error.  The solution demonstrates improved error handling by using a conditional check before attempting division.

## Bug

The original code throws an error when dividing by zero. The `try-catch` block prevents the program from crashing, but the error message might not be user-friendly.

## Solution

The solution provides better error handling. It checks for division by zero before performing the operation. This makes the error handling more robust and less likely to throw unexpected errors.
